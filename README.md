# AI-Driven Narrative Pipeline
## A hierarchical, iterative approach to narrative construction:

### Layered Story Architecture: 
Our system builds stories through interconnected layers (outline → story elements → arc overview → arc details → episode overview → episode details), creating a structured foundation that ensures coherence.
### Persistent Narrative Memory: 
By leveraging MongoDB to store story components across dedicated collections (user, arcs, episodes), we maintain a comprehensive narrative memory that transcends typical LLM context limitations.
### Iterative Refinement Cycles: 
Our feedback-driven approach allows users to refine content at each narrative level, ensuring quality and consistency while accommodating creative evolution.
### Smart Context Management: 
By decomposing stories into logical hierarchies, we effectively manage context without losing narrative coherence, allowing generation of stories of unlimited length.
### Character Continuity Mechanism: 
Character details persist across episodes through our database architecture, ensuring consistent personalities, motivations, and development arcs.
